I am doing a infinite Runners Game for NOVA (nova.uni-greifswald.de)

Therefor I need:
1. a runner ( this need to run, needs to be there and needs to jump)
2. points (runner needs to collect them and there has to be something that counts the amount of coins)
3. threats, (something that makes you lose points when you collide with them, when the runner hits them, the value of the threat needs to be subtracted from the sum of points)
4. an infinite backgroundimage
5. a game class where images are loaded, the game is drawn and setup
6. a main file, where the game is initiated ( setup (canvas), preload,)

Player
-where in the canva is the player inititated?
